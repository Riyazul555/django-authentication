Django Authentication
Signup Function:

The signup function allows users to create new accounts on your platform. Users provide necessary information, such as a unique username, email address, and a secure password during the signup process. You may implement additional features like email verification or captcha for added security.

Signin Function:

The signin function handles user authentication, enabling registered users to log in securely. Users typically input their credentials, such as username or email, and password to gain access to their accounts. Your implementation should verify the provided information against the stored user data in the database.

Logout Function:

The logout function terminates a user's current session, ensuring that the user is securely logged out. This is essential for maintaining the security and privacy of the user's account. After logging out, users need to re-authenticate to access protected resources. These three functions collectively form the core of user authentication in your Django project, providing a secure and user-friendly environment for account management. Additionally, you might have implemented features like password recovery or profile management to enhance the overall user experience. Always prioritize security measures, such as password hashing and protection against common vulnerabilities, to safeguard user accounts and sensitive information.
